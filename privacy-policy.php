 <h4>Privacy Policy Page</h4>
 <p>
At Eduford, we understand that the privacy of your personal information is important to you and to us. <br>
Below is information about the types of personal information we receive and collect when you visit Eduford, and how we protect your personal information. <br>
Log files <br>
As is the case with most websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. <br>
The information in the log files includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your Internet Service Provider (ISP), the browser you used to visit our Site, the time of your visit, and the pages you visit across our Site. <br>
Cookies <br>
We use cookies to give you the best possible user experience on the simple website. For more information about cookies, visit: http://localhost/university/index.php. <br>
Essential cookies <br>
Essential cookies are essential for you to navigate and move around the website, and do not store any information that can be used for advertising purposes. Without essential cookies, our website will not function properly. <br>
Personalized cookies <br>
These cookies store information, such as your personal preferences, and use it to customize a unique experience for you. <br>
This may include showing you a pop-up only once during your visit, saving your language preferences, or allowing you to automatically sign in to some of our features. <br>
Analytics cookies <br>
Analytics cookies capture anonymous data so we can see trends and improve your website experience. <br>
These allow us to test different designs, and help us identify breakage if part of our site isn't working. <br>
Advertising cookies <br>
Some third-party advertisers may use cookies or web beacons when advertising on our site. <br>
These will send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases information about whether you have Flash installed. <br>
• Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's past visits to our website or other sites on the web. <br>
• Using advertising cookies, Google and its partners will be able to serve ads to your users based on their visit to our site and/or other sites on the Internet. <br>
• Users can opt out of the use of personalized advertising by going to Ads Settings. <br>
If you do not choose to opt out of serving third-party ads, cookies from other third-party ad networks or vendors may also be used to serve ads on our site. <br>
This is generally used for geotargeting purposes for example (showing SEO ads in Germany to someone in Germany) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing real estate ads to someone who frequents real estate sites). <br>
By continuing to use our site, you agree to the placement of cookies on your device. You can choose to selectively disable or turn off cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings. However, this can affect how you interact with our site as well as other websites. <br>
If you have any questions or there is any problem with our data use policy, please contact us through the contact us page.</p>
